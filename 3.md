A comprehensive approach to faculty members’ promotion policies Mohsen Azimi Nezhad1, Farin Tatari, Abasalt Borji Abstract Background: Promotion of human resources of organizations is one of the aspects of human resource management ‎which is important and adopting appropriate policies in this area could have a significant impact on the progression of ‎the organization. Promotion system of faculty members in higher education institutions plays a major role in directing ‎their scientific activities‏ ‏and as one of the most important components of performance improvement and retention of ‎faculty members is an essential part in the academic success of faculty members and universities, therefore has a special ‎position in higher education policymaking. Considering the importance of faculty members' promotion system, we ‎decided to conduct a study in this area.‎ Methods: This study was conducted using the methodology of critical review. Related terminology was selected and ‎extensive and structured search of texts were conducted.280 texts and articles were achieved. Then according to ‎purposive sampling screening of texts was conducted in three stages:‎‏ ‏‎(A) Initial or title screening, (B) Secondary ‎screening, (C) Tertiary screening. 45 articles were analyzed.‎ Results: Universities review the competencies and merits of faculty members and interfere this merit-based evaluation ‎in faculty members' promotion. Faculty members' activities are evaluated in the areas of education, research and ‎administrative services by promotion committees. Weighting these areas is different according to universities and ‎departments but educational activities are one of the most important and essential areas in faculty members' promotion. ‎There is direct connection between the level of promotion and the extent of promotion candidates' educational ‎excellence at all levels of promotion. This educational excellence and reputation of faculty member should be at the ‎college level at the Assistant professor rank, at the national and regional level at the associate professor rank, and at the ‎national and international level at the professorship rank. Strengthen students' independent thinking and reasoning is ‎outstanding advantages of educational criteria. In research area in addition to the number of articles, articles quality and ‎number of citation is important. Many universities continue the promotion process after professor rank. Some ‎universities apply the policy granting promotion to faculty members only according to excellence in teaching or ‎research‎‎.

EDUCATING PHYSICIANS: RESEARCH REPORTS Criteria of the “Educators' Pyramid” Fulfilled by Medical School Faculty Promoted on a Teaching Pathway Sherertz, Elizabeth F. MD Author Information Academic Medicine 75(9):p 954-956, September 2000. Buy Abstract Purpose To compare the results of academic promotion to associate professor and professor via the teaching pathway at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFUSM) with the criteria of the “educators' pyramid” of Sachdeva et al. Method Data on all candidates promoted to associate professor and professor in the academic years 1995–2000 at WFUSM were collected from candidates' portfolios and compared with the criteria for educator (level three) and master educator (level four) from a modified version of the educators' pyramid. Results Of 186 faculty promoted, 38 were on the teaching pathway. Everyone promoted on the pathway fulfilled all teacher and master teacher criteria. All educator criteria were found among the associate professors, and all but one of the master educator criteria were found among professors. More than 75% of associate professors demonstrated “sustained participation in significant amounts of effective teaching in more than one modality” and “service as a medical student clerkship, course, or residency director.” Less than 30% demonstrated “service as assistant dean of education or student affairs” or “service as the chair of departmental education committees.” Most associate professors had not regularly participated in national education meetings. For professors, more than 50% demonstrated “achievement of leadership positions in national organizations, committees, and medical school education”; “recognition as a national leader in specialty education”; and “mentorship of other faculty members locally and nationally.” Less than 30% demonstrated “pursuit of further training in education through workshops, faculty development programs, or educational fellowship programs” or “development and implementation of nationally-recognized (in education) innovative curricula or teaching programs.” No one promoted to professor on the teaching pathway had made what was considered to be a landmark contribution to educational research and development. Conclusion The findings suggest that the educators' pyramid is generalizable to medical faculty being promoted on a teaching pathway at WFUSM. Documentation of achievement in teaching criteria is essential and faculty should be encouraged to maintain records of accomplishment before becoming candidates for promotion.

Promotion criteria, faculty experiences and perceptions: A qualitative study at a key university in China Author links open overlay panel Jingning Zhang Show more Add to Mendeley Share Cite https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedudev.2012.04.004 Get rights and content Abstract The purposes of this micro-level, detailed qualitative study of a university faculty in a large city in China are threefold: to identify the sources of institutional promotion criteria, to illustrate the experiences of frontline faculty members with these criteria and their perceptions of them, and to discuss the possible bearings of the findings on the modification and reform of the existing system for faculty evaluation and promotion in China. The data and analyses suggest that promotion criteria at the institutional level are largely influenced and determined by the policies that are developed by regimes at the national level. My research further suggests that faculty members are highly reflexive and pragmatic with respect to external definitions of scholarship. Future efforts in faculty evaluation and promotion might need to move the locus of the teaching criteria for promotion to the departmental and workgroup levels and broaden the research criteria to include faculty “knowledge application.” Research work may need to be reviewed for content rather than evaluated in terms of language or quantity. Highlights ► In this study I examine the promotion criteria at a Chinese university and elaborate on faculty experiences and perceptions of them. ► Data analysis suggests that institutional promotion criteria are to a large extent influenced by the policy regimes at the national level. ► Faculties are highly reflexive and pragmatic in face of external sources of scholarship definition. ► Future reform efforts might need to move the locus of teaching promotion criteria down to the departmental and workgroup levels. ► And broaden research promotion criteria to include faculty “knowledge application.” Introduction The purposes of this micro-level, detailed qualitative study of a university faculty in a large city in China are threefold: to identify the sources of institutional promotion criteria, to illustrate the experiences of frontline faculty members with these criteria and their perceptions of them, and to discuss the pertinence of the findings for an emerging body of literature that indicates the need for modification and a reform of the current faculty promotion and evaluation system. In Western “core” countries, especially in the United States, there is a plethora of conceptual and empirical research on the definition of scholarship and the academic reward structure. In particular, a substantial body of literature examines how tenure and promotion systems shape (or fail to shape) faculty values, behaviors and the construction of personal and professional identities (e.g., Boyer, 1990, Blackburn and Lawrence, 1995, Diamond, 1993, Fairweather, 1996, Fairweather, 2002, Lincoln, 1983, O’Meara and Rice, 2005, Tierney, 1999, Shen, 1997, Youn and Price, 2009). This body of literature both informs leaders and administrators in their policymaking and reform initiatives and contributes to an understanding of how faculties have maintained “the rigor and reputation of US scholarship for more than a century” (Boardman and Ponomariov, 2007, p. 65) in relation to the academic reward structure and attendant institutional arrangements. Given the paucity of this type of research in China, especially in terms of empirical studies, I discuss faculty experiences and perceptions of the reward system (i.e., the promotion criteria). I obtained empirical data pertaining to the teaching and research criteria for promotion from the rank of lecturer through associate to full professor and of the promotion to doctoral advisor status. Following this data collection, I explained how faculty members suggested that the definition of scholarship is derived from the larger policy-making levels above them – the discourse on national reform and quality. Subsequently, I explicated how frontline faculty members experience, perceive or even reconstitute the promotion criteria for teaching and research in their mundane workday activities and duties. The detailed research questions are as follows: (1) What are the concrete promotion criteria at the university, and how are they related to the broader conversations regarding reform and quality? (2) What are the experiences of faculty members and their perceptions of these criteria? Furthermore, drawing on the empirical data, I discussed the pertinence of the findings of this article to an emerging body of literature on the amendment of the existing academic reward structure. Caution must be exercised with regard to the universal generalization of the findings of this study to any Chinese university because of the qualitative design of the study, which was based on a limited number of samples. The readers are invited to reflect on the emergent themes and evaluate whether the findings are transferable to their own contexts. As Boardman and Ponomariov (2007) scrupulously refer to their study as an “incremental step” toward an understanding of the misalignment between the traditional reward system and faculty expectations and behaviors, I only examined the emerging themes of my own study as they relate to the intensely debated topics in teaching and research evaluation in the primarily Western-based literature. A solid “evidentiary foundation” to amend and reform the current faculty reward structure in China has yet to be constructed; this endeavor might require the efforts of numerous empirical researchers.

Section snippets Background In this section, I first provide a description of “key” universities and the different academic ranks and titles in China. Subsequently, I construct a brief glossary of some of the procedures that are used to assure academic quality with “Chinese characteristics” at the national, provincial, municipal and institutional levels. As these procedures serve as information about or as components of the promotion criteria, the glossary might prove to be indispensable despite its apparent irrelevance The sources of promotion criteria Two streams of the literature on promotion criteria are helpful in constructing the theoretical framework; each stream is related to a respective research question and has informed the collection of empirical data pertaining to the sources and reception of the promotion criteria. The first research question in this article concerns the sources of promotion criteria at the university at which the data were collected. Even the staunchest defenders of faculty self-governance in Western “core” Setting The university at which the data were collected is one of the oldest and most prestigious key universities in China, and its main campus is located in the center of a large Chinese city. When I was visiting the university during November 2008 and January 2009, the university consisted of six campuses: one old campus, three campuses that were acquired through a merger, one newly constructed campus, and one private-sector “autonomous” campus. Because my initial interviews, which were conducted at Teaching promotion criteria I will elaborate on the teaching criteria for junior faculty members under the age of 40, as these criteria are more specific and restrictive in comparison to the teaching criteria for promotion from associate professor to the rank of full professor or the doctoral advisor status. All junior faculty members applying for the rank of associate professor are required to enter university-level teaching competitions and to receive third place or higher to qualify for promotion. As I have explained Implications The empirical data suggest that the university follows centralized, expert-oriented teaching evaluation procedures that are based on the “executive” model. In addition, the research criteria rely on a “tripod”: official grants, awards from governmental research competitions and publications in international journal publications. These emphases suggest the role of bureaucratic influences on the definition of scholarship at the local level. The frontline faculty members who were interviewed for

Assessment of educational criteria in academic promotion Perspectives of faculty members of medical sciences universities in Iran Tootoonchi, Mina; Yamani, Nikoo1,; Changiz, Tahereh1; Taleghani, Fariba; Mohammadzadeh, Zahra2 Author Information Journal of Education and Health Promotion 3(1):p 29, | DOI: 10.4103/2277-9531.131893 Open Metrics Abstract Introduction: One of the important criteria in the promotion of faculty members is in the scope of their educational roles and duties. The purpose of this study was the assessment of reasonability and attainability of educational criteria for scientific rank promotion from the perspective of the faculty members of Medical Sciences Universities in Iran. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study was conducted in 2011 in 13 Universities of Medical Sciences in Iran. Through stratified sampling method, 350 faculty members were recruited. A questionnaire developed by the researchers was used to investigate the reasonability and attainability of educational criteria with scores from 1 to 5. The self-administered questionnaire was distributed and collected at each university. The mean and standard deviation of reasonability and attainability scores were calculated and reported by using the SPSS software version 16. Results: Faculty members considered many criteria of educational activities reasonable and available (with a mean score of more than 3). The highest reasonability and attainability have been obtained by the quantity and quality of teaching with the mean scores (3.93 ± 1.15 and 3.82 ± 1.17) and (3.9 ± 1.22 and 4.13 ± 1.06) out of five, respectively. The mean and standard deviation of total scores of reasonability of educational activities were 50.91 ± 14.22 and its attainability was 60.3 ± 13.72 from the total score of 90. Discussion and Conclusion: The faculty members of the Universities of Medical Sciences in Iran considered the educational criteria of promotion moderately reasonable and achievable. It is recommended to revise these criteria and adapt them according to the mission and special conditions of medical universities. Furthermore, providing feedback of evaluations, running educational researches, and implementing faculty development programs are suggested. INTRODUCTION Rank promotion of faculty members of the universities of medical sciences in Iran is subject to earn the specific points for each scientific category based on the specified criteria by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran. It is performed by evaluating the quality and quantity of educational-research and executive activities and more recently, the cultural activities of the faculty members.[1] One of the primary and essential activities of the faculty members is teaching, which includes carrying out some duties such as: Teaching theoretical and practical courses to the students, supervising the thesis in different levels, curriculum planning and revising, and using appropriate teaching methods.[1] Faculty members expect to have the possibility to achieve a higher academic level by appropriate and effective teaching.[2] For providing the rank promotion in the world's most prestigious universities, it is essential for the faculty members to provide a report from their scientific background (Curriculum Vita). This includes their performance and a description of their educational activities such as the quantity and quality of teaching in different fields from classrooms to seminars, training and clinical mentoring, leadership and creativity in designing and development of courses, and learning and evaluation tools. This CV also includes, evidences of educational scholarship such as publishing educational articles, the description of professional practices based on clinical performance in terms of size, extent of the work and its importance, a report of internal and external reviewers of activities, evidences of academic excellence and scientific superiority, and their growth and development plans for their next rank promotion along with a summary of research activities.[3456] Promotion is a process for improvement of scientific value of the faculty members and academia. The promotion criteria and expected points in the evaluation of faculty members are necessary to be adjusted according to the facilities, and scientific, human, social and economic resources, as well as physical capacities and the technology of the scientific centers.[7] It has to be mentioned that faculty members should work in respect to their educational role on one hand and try for their scientific promotion on the other hand. Difficulties in performing research and promotion to a higher scientific rank has been mentioned in many studies in western countries.[589] Achieving promotion is not easy and requires effort, completion of tasks, and expectations in line with the multiple roles. Unsuitable criteria for promotion can be problematic. Difficulty or ease, reasonability of the criteria and their sustainability can influence the educational system and cause dynamic and development of educational skills or even the decline of faculty members for promotion.[8] Furthermore, in Iran, faculty promotion is somehow problematic. Since 1985, the medical part of Ministry of Higher Education was integrated with Ministry of Health and hence the faculty members of Medical Universities have to spend much of their time for patient care and management and have limited time for education and research. This is while, in promotion criteria, there is no place for patient care activities and pays only to educational, research, and executive activities. The question is, if the expectations and educational criteria in promotion by law are just and achievable from the viewpoints of faculty members? The used criteria for promotion in different countries are somewhat different. The American Association of Medical Colleges and education-related groups have identified five categories of activities including, teaching, curriculum planning, counseling, and educational and management leadership and student assessment as the required standards for educators and promotion scientific committees.[9] Educational policy makers develop the regulations considering the mentioned criteria. A study showed that the educational criteria for promotion in Iran compared with developed countries are more limited and even less than neighboring country of Turkey.[7] Clinical faculty members of the United States and Canadian medical schools were concerned about their ability for promotion and the desired criteria of the promotion committees.[10] In another study, the faculty members believed that administrators did not give enough value for teaching activities. The promotion committee decisions reveals that educational scholarship is not emphasized enough. For this reason, some medical schools have tried to consider some criteria for achieving the valuable educational standards, which causes the faculty members feel valuable too.[11] Determining the criteria without asking the view of faculty members have led to some resistance in them while, their participation in determining the evaluation criteria and the design process could help in acceptance of such evaluations.[12] Existing information about the acceptance of educational promotion criteria is limited, particularly in the Middle East. The perspectives of educational faculty members about the educational criteria for promotion and the reasonability of the scores considered for such criteria can introduce the status, problems, and the current challenges of the faculty members in promotion. The purpose of this study was the assessment of reasonability and attainability of educational criteria for academic rank promotion from the perspectives of faculty members of the Medical Sciences Universities of Iran in 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in 13 universities of medical sciences in Iran in 2011. These universities were divided depending on the extent of their activity, their experiences, and capabilities in training graduate students in to three types of 1, 2, and 3.[13] The study population included the faculty members of Governmental Universities of Medical Sciences in Iran. The number of subjects was 350, who were selected by stratified random sampling method in terms of types 1, 2, and 3 universities. Samples were included 160 faculty members from four universities of type 1, 120 from four universities of type 2, 60 from five universities of type 3, and 10 from the promotion committee members in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. The faculty members were at least assistant professor, with a degree higher than Master and member of one of the Educational Department with at least 5-year experience at the same university. In Iran, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education is responsible for compiling the faculty members’ promotion by law and determines the promotion criteria and the process for calculating the scores. The Universities are obligated to respect this by law. In this study, the same by law has been investigated. The questionnaire topics were included the quantity and quality of teaching, supervising the thesis in different levels, designing, revising and implementing training programs, utilizing new methods of teaching and having educational awards. The questionnaire measured the faculty members’ perspectives in terms of reasonability and attainability of each indicator with a scale ranging from 1 to 5. The score of 1 indicated the minimum, and a score of 5 represented the maximum score. The content validity and face validity of the questionnaires were determined making sure of following promotion by law and obtaining the opinions of the experts in the Medical Education Research Center, some of the members of promotion committee and faculty member experts. The reliability of the questionnaire was obtained by calculating Cronbach's alpha equal to 0.865. The questionnaires were sent by mail or given face-to-face to the authorities of Medical Education Development Centers of the universities. They were returned by a distributor or mailed to the researchers after 1 week. Several follow-ups (3 times) were performed to increase the response rate of the questionnaires. Questionnaires were completed with the subjects consent and the received information was considered confidential. The mean and standard deviation of reasonability and attainability scores were calculated with SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social science) software version 16. The three type universities were compared using One-way ANOVA. RESULTS In this study, among 350 distributed questionnaires, 279 questionnaires were received and after excluding incomplete and problematic ones, 268 questionnaires were considered in the calculations. The questionnaire return rate was 75.57%. The following mean scores, standard deviation and percentages were obtained: Faculty members mean age (45.36 ± 7.07) years old, the male majority (66.41%), clinical faculty members (53.73%), assistant professor (46.26%), associate professor (36.57%,) and full professor (17.16%). The majority of 52.6% of the faculty members were promoted and 47.4% were not promoted yet. 41% of the faculty members had a membership in promotion committees and 16.7% had a history of membership in the distinguishing board. The findings showed that the faculty members considered many criteria for promotion of educational activities reasonable and achievable by providing the mean scores of greater than three. The highest mean score of reasonability indicator was related to the quantity and quality of teaching with a relatively high score (greater than 3.5) and thereafter, the highest scores were obtained by medical, MS, and PhD thesis. The lowest mean of reasonability was assigned to curriculum design, revising curriculum, and educational awards [Table 1]. In terms of the attainability of the criteria, the highest mean was gained by the quantity and quality of teaching, and thesis. The lowest mean was assigned for curriculum design and revising [Table 1]. The mean and standard deviation of the total scores of reasonability of sixteen investigated criteria were 50.91 ± 14.22 out of the total score of 90. Based on total scores divided by the number of criteria, 3.18 ± 0.88 was obtained out of five. The mean of total scores of the attainability of 16 investigated criteria was 60.3 ± 13.72 out of the total score of 90. Based on the total scores divided by the number of criteria, 3.76 ± 0.85 was obtained out of five. In the promotion regulations, a minimum score must be achieved for some activities and having these scores are necessary for those who are eligible. Without obtaining these minimums, it is not possible for the faculty members to be promoted. The faculty members of Iran medical sciences universities assessed the minimum required score for the quantity and quality of education reasonable with a relatively high-score (greater than 4) and the minimum required score for its attainability was estimated somewhat favorable for all educational activities. However, the minimum required score for the scholarship was assessed with lower scores [Table 2]. One-way ANOVA showed no significance difference between the results of three type universities. Furthermore, the viewpoints of faculty members of different type universities regarding promotion criteria were similar. About necessary minimum scores for some educational criteria, there was a significant difference between the total score of these criteria in three type universities but the difference in sub-criteria was not significant [Table 3].

Relative Importance of Performance Criteria in Promotion and Tenure Decisions: Perceptions of Pharmacy Faculty Members Alan P. Wolfgang, Gireesh V. Gupchup and Kimberly S. Plake School of Pharmacy and Pharmacal Sciences, 1335 R. Heine Pharmacy Building, Purdue University, West Lafayette IN 47907-1335 A study was conducted to determine pharmacy faculty members’ perceptions of the importance currently placed on various criteria when promotion and tenure decisions are being made and how those perceptions compare with the importance they believe should be placed on the same set of criteria. Data were collected via questionnaires mailed to 300 randomly selected full-time U.S. pharmacy school faculty members. Analysis of data from 197 respondents revealed that the evaluation criteria for which respondents perceived the greatest current importance included: refereed publications; extramural funding; the department chair’s evaluation; and invited scholarly presentations. The performance criteria for which there were the largest differences between current and preferred importance included: evaluation of instructional materials; evidence of teaching improvement efforts; peer evaluation within the institution; and self-assessment. These findings have important implications for the process utilized to evaluate pharmacy faculty members when making promotion and tenure decisions. INTRODUCTION Although it has been noted that colleges and universities “do not often undertake comprehensive studies of their academic promotion and tenure systems”(1), it also is recognized that in the past few years “university presidents and provosts across the country began charging task forces to reexamine various aspects of the faculty reward system,” including the criteria for promotion and advancement(2). But why has there been so much interest in reconsidering the means by which institutions of higher learning evaluate and reward faculty performance? Much of this interest has been credited to faculty members’ growing concerns about promotion and tenure processes. Based on the results of a 1989 nationwide survey of college and university faculty, Ernest Boyer concluded that substantial numbers of American faculty members were dissatisfied with the systems being used to evaluate their performance(3). Similarly, Richard Miller has observed that “such systems tend to be sources of dissatisfaction and objects of suspicion among faculty members”(1), while Braskamp and Ory have stated that “the credibility of faculty assessment remains one of the most precarious and sensitive issues on campus”(4). The importance of reconsidering faculty assessment methods was further emphasized in the 1991-92 report of the AACP Council of Deans/Council of Faculties Joint Committee on Faculty Recruitment and Retention, which concluded that “the three most important factors that could cause faculty to seek employment outside of academia dealt with reward systems and opportunities for advancement and professional growth”(5). Much of this apparent faculty member dissatisfaction relates to a desire for greater balance in the emphasis placed on various aspects of their performance. There appears to be a widespread perception that research-based factors receive too much emphasis in the assessment of faculty, while teaching and service remain undervalued(2,6-8). Many of these concerns were captured by Boyer when he stated: . . . the requirements of tenure and promotion continue to focus heavily on research and on articles published in journals, especially those that are refereed... Good teaching is expected, but is often inadequately assessed. And the category of “service,” while given token recognition by most colleges, is consistently underrated, too(3). Performance evaluation and reward systems also are believed to play an important role in determining the amount of stress which faculty members experience. In their study of faculty at doctorate-granting institutions across the United States, for example, Gmelch et al. identified professional recognition and rewards as a primary source of faculty stress(9). Similarly, Arnold has asserted that the foundation of all faculty stress is inadequate recognition and reward for teaching(10). Seldin relates faculty stress to the need for achieving balance in evaluation and reward systems, noting that faculty members “feel pulled in opposite directions. They are told that classroom teaching is of vital importance, but teachers soon learn from experience that research matters more for promotion and tenure”(11). He goes on to point out that much of this stress stems from a discrepancy between the relative importance institutions place on research, teaching, and service and “the relative importance faculty would prefer”(11). This potential discrepancy also was highlighted by Jarvis when he stated, “More interesting to consider than present reward structures is the issue of what. . . faculty members think should be rewarded”(6). But what performance criteria do faculty members in U.S. schools and colleges of pharmacy believe should be rewarded? How do these preferences compare to their perceptions of the current basis for promotion and tenure decisions? The purpose of the present study was to help answer these types of questions. The specific objectives of the research were to: (i) measure pharmacy faculty members’ perceptions of the importance currently placed on various criteria when promotion and tenure decisions are being made; 342 American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education Vol. 59, Winter 1995 Table I.

(ii) determine the importance which pharmacy faculty members believe should be placed on the same criteria in such decision-making processes; (iii) assess differences between the current and preferred importance of each criterion; and (iv) evaluate the relationships between pharmacy faculty members’ demographic characteristics and their perceptions of these promotion and tenure criteria. METHODS The study sample was drawn from the population of fulltime faculty members at the rank of assistant professor or higher in U.S. schools and colleges of pharmacy. Utilizing the 1994-1995 AACP Roster of Faculty and Professional Staff(12), 300 faculty members were randomly selected as potential study participants. In February 1995, each of the these faculty members was mailed a cover letter and threepage questionnaire via first-class postage. The questionnaire consisted of two sections. The first section listed 29 criteria, derived from a review of the literature, that are commonly utilized when faculty mem bers are being evaluated for promotion and tenure decisions (see Table II). Respondents first indicated how much importance they believed was currently placed on each criterion within their institutions. Next, they were asked to indicate how much importance they felt should be placed on each criterion when promotion and tenure decisions are being made. Ratings for both current and preferred importance were provided on a five-point, Likert-type scale (from 1 = “Not important” to 5 = “Very important”). The second section of the questionnaire collected information on a variety of demographic characteristics, including academic discipline, academic rank, tenure status, administrative position, gender, age, and highest degree attained. After one follow-up mailing, responses were received from 197 faculty members, yielding a 65.7 percent response rate. Data were analyzed using programs of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). RESULTS The demographic characteristics of the 197 responding faculty members are summarized in Table I. Women constituted 21.0 percent of the sample and nearly 57 percent of the respondents were tenured. Approximately 37 percent of the respondents identified pharmacy practice as their academic discipline, 57.7 percent had earned a Ph.D., and 3.0 percent were deans. By comparison, the 1994-95 Profile of Pharmacy Faculty indicated that of all full-time pharmacy faculty members at the rank of assistant professor or higher: 27.3 percent were female; 48.8 percent were tenured; 43.0 percent were in pharmacy practice; 54.5 percent had earned a PhD; and 2.3 percent were deans(13). Table II presents the mean current and preferred importance for each of the 29 promotion and tenure criteria. The five criteria which faculty members perceived as having the greatest current importance in promotion and tenure decisions were: “Publications of results of research and scholarly activities in refereed journals,” “Funding by government and private agencies,” “Department/division chair’s evaluation of the faculty member,” “Invited presentations on research and scholarly work,” and “Contributed papers at scientific and professional meetings.” In contrast, the five criteria viewed as currently being least important were: “Participation in community activities,” “Individual faculty member’s self-assessment,” “Informal opinions of students and/or alumni,” “Evaluation of instructional materials,” and “Evidence of efforts taken to improve teaching.” As can be seen in Table II, several of the criteria viewed as being highest in current importance also received relatively high ratings when pharmacy faculty members were asked about the level of importance they believed should be allotted to those criteria. The five criteria with the highest preferred importance scores were: “Publications of results of research and scholarly activities in refereed journals,” “Invited presentations on research and scholarly work,” “Contributed papers at scientific and professional meetings,” “Other scholarly writing,” and “Peer evaluation either through a structured peer review committee or by input from peers within your institution with relevant backgrounds.” Conversely, the criteria to which respondents preferred the least importance be given included: “Informal opinions of students and/or alumni,” “Publications in nonrefereed journals,” “Participation in community activities,” “Patents granted.” and “Citations in published materials.”

A critical component of the progression of a successful academic career is being promoted in rank. Early-career faculty are required to have an understanding of appointment, promotion, and tenure (APT) guidelines, but many factors often impede this understanding, thwarting a smooth and planned promotion pathway for professional advancement. This article outlines the steps taken by an APT committee to improve the promotion process from instructor to assistant professor. Six sigma's DMAIC improvement model was selected as the guiding operational framework to remove variation in the promotion process. After faculty handbook revisions were made, several checklists developed, and a process review rubric was implemented; recently promoted faculty were surveyed on satisfaction with the process. Faculty opinions captured in the survey suggest increased transparency in the process and perceived support offered by the APT committee. Positive outcomes include a strengthened faculty support framework, streamlined promotion processes, and improved faculty satisfaction. Changes to the APT processes resulted in an unambiguous and standardized pathway for successful promotion.

Section snippets Background In 2013, a new cohort of APT committee members observed that there was a need to improve the processes related to promotion. An informal needs assessment revealed that early-career faculty at the instructor or assistant professor ranks found the promotion process cumbrous and difficult to navigate. Misinformation was often shared between faculty who had previously been promoted and early-career faculty seeking promotion. Some of this information was useful, and other aspects were misleading. Process Improvement Model The APT committee believe that faculty success rests on many interrelated factors that must all work to maintain a consistent state of collaboration. A key factor in faculty achievement is guidelines integrated in a framework that supports faculty (Papaconstantinou & Lairmore, 2006). The APT committee developed the faculty success framework (see Figure 1) that includes the following domains: APT guidance for promotion; department chair leadership; teaching evaluations; innovative clinical care; Methods The DMAIC model's step-by-step approach assisted the team to clearly measure processes and translate the problem into measurable goals. The team analyzed influencing factors to ascertain key stakeholders and gaps in the APT process. The team brainstormed ideas to eliminate problems within the process. This resulted in development of a revised handbook that included forms to guide early-career faculty through the APT process. In addition, an assessment rubric was developed to aid APT committee Results By using the six sigma process, new tools, structure, and processes were developed to aid in early-career faculty promotion. Promotion standards are now unambiguous and have resulted in the following benefits: a supportive framework, a more streamlined promotion process, and improved faculty performance and satisfaction. In addition, 15 of 16 early-career faculty hired by the college in 2012 and 2013 remain employed with the college. Of the 10 new faculty hired at the rank of instructor, six Discussion The best strategies that came out of this process improvement project were integration of a systematic, methodical approach to APT committee promotion processes, a mentoring consultation process to facilitate faculty success, and transparency of the criteria for promotion and APT process. The promotion process was streamlined to include a systematic and clearly delineated plan that makes the promotion process transparent and easier for faculty to navigate. Identifying these appropriate steps Conclusion The APT committee at the CON successfully developed a plan to help early-career nursing faculty clearly understand expectations and prepare for promotion. Changes to the process will assist early-career instructors and assistant professors with timely planning to ensure readiness in all aspects of the promotion criteria. Faculty are now able to locate information in the faculty handbook and are better prepared to meet with the APT committee and navigate the process to be successful in the quest
