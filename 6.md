Best and Worst Professors: Gender Patterns in Students' Choices Published: September 2000 Volume 43, pages 407–417, (2000) Cite this article Sex Roles Aims and scope Submit manuscript Susan A. Basow 934 Accesses 63 Citations Explore all metrics Abstract Over 100 primarily White students described their best and worst professor. For “best,” female professors were chosen more by their female students and less by their male students than expected. There were no gender differences in choice of “worst” professors. The qualities that students criticize are similar for their male and female professors, mainly a lack of organization and clarity. “Best” professors most often are described as caring and knowledgeable, but other qualities vary as a function of professor or student gender. These findings suggest that more attention should be paid to gender dynamics in classroom teaching and in student evaluations.

The study took place in a private university (n = 103,833) on six different campuses in the north region of Mexico. The distribution of the professors’ gender was analyzed according to semesters, campuses, and schools. Our findings suggested that when undergraduates evaluated their professors on specific criteria concerning teaching performance, they expressed their opinion regardless of the professors' gender. However, when being asked for a single overall evaluation, as whether they would recommend the professor as one of their best professors, the students tended to favor male professors over their female peers by a slight margin. While such perceptions might not be representative of the actual teaching quality, it would be interesting in the future to delve deeper into the causes of possible biases. Keywords

To assess the perceptions of SETs, all teaching faculty in one college at a western Land Grant University were asked to complete an anonymous online survey. The survey included demographic questions (i.e. gender; rank such as assistant, associate, and full professor; and positions like non-tenure track, tenure track, and tenured) as well as questions related to faculty's feelings while reading their SETs. While minimal differences were found in responses based on rank or position, several differences were found based on faculty gender. Overall, female faculty appear to be more negatively impacted by student evaluations than male faculty. These gender differences support previous research that suggests males and females receive and react differently to personal evaluation. Resultant suggestions include modifying surveys from anonymous to confidential and offering professional development training for faculty.

Effects of Course and Instructor Characteristics on Student Evaluation of Teaching across a College of Engineering Michael D. Johnson, Arunachalam Narayanan, William J. Sawaya First published: 19 July 2013 https://doi.org/10.1002/jee.20013Citations: 32 Read the full text PDFTools Share Abstract Background Student evaluations of teaching (SETs) are a widely used metric to evaluate instructor effectiveness and are used to make promotion, tenure, and retention decisions for faculty. There is also growing interest by those outside the university community to use these metrics to evaluate faculty and broader academic performance. Purpose (Hypothesis) This study seeks to understand if and how course and instructor characteristics affect SETs and thereby to improve the usefulness of these metrics. This article aims to statistically examine the relationship between course and instructor characteristics and SETs. Design/Method SETs from a large engineering college at a major public university were evaluated over a seven-semester period that covered 3938 courses taught by 549 unique engineering instructors. Course and instructor demographic data were statistically evaluated for their effects on SETs. Results Course characteristics such as class size, course level, and whether a course was an elective or required had statistically significant effects on SETs. Instructor characteristics of gender and academic rank affected SETs and average course grades, respectively. Average course grades were positively correlated with SETs. Conclusions Data analysis showed that course characteristics, faculty demographics, and average course grades had statistically significant effects on SETs; however, in some cases the effect sizes of these variables were small. Administrators and senior faculty members should be cognizant of these relevant factors and their effects when assigning faculty to certain courses and evaluating their teaching effectiveness using SETs.

Female Surgeons as Counter Stereotype: The Impact of Gender Perceptions on Trainee Evaluations of Physician Faculty Author links open overlay panel Magali Fassiotto PhD * , Jie Li PhD † , Yvonne Maldonado MD * ‡ , Nishita Kothary MD § Show more Add to Mendeley Share Cite https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2018.01.011 Get rights and content Objective Similar to women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines, women in medicine are subject to negative stereotyping when they do not adhere to their sex-role expectations. These biases may vary by specialty, largely dependent on the gender’s representation in that specialty. Thus, females in male-dominated surgical specialties are especially at risk of stereotype threat. Herein, we present the role of gender expectations using trainee evaluations of physician faculty at a single academic center, over a 5-year period (2010-2014). Design Using Graduate Medical Education evaluation data of physician faculty from MedHub, we examined the differences in evaluation scores for male and female physicians within specialties that have traditionally had low female representation (e.g., surgical fields) compared to those with average or high female representation (e.g., pediatrics). Setting Stanford Medicine residents and fellows’ MedHub ratings of their physician faculty from 2010 to 2014. Participants A total of 3648 evaluations across 1066 physician faculty. Results Overall, female physicians received lower median scores than their male counterparts across all specialties. When using regression analyses controlling for race, age, rank, and specialty-specific characteristics, the negative effect persists only for female physicians in specialties with low female representation. Conclusions This finding suggests that female physicians in traditionally male-dominated specialties may face different criteria based on sex-role expectations when being evaluated by trainees. As trainee evaluations play an important role in career advancement decisions, dictate perceptions of quality within academic medical centers and affect overall job satisfaction, we propose that these differences in evaluations based merely on gender stereotypes could account, in part, for the narrowing pipeline of women promoted to higher ranks in academic medicine. Introduction The importance and validity of feedback provided by students regarding faculty and the quality of education they provide has been backed by an extensive body of literature.1, 2, 3 Student evaluations are the cornerstone for tenure and promotional decisions at universities, directly affecting employment decisions.1, 4 Although some research supports that faculty gender plays a negligible role on evaluations,5, 6, 7, 8, 9 these studies examine gender in isolation. However, gender bias is often subtle, occurring in interaction with other variables such as sex-role expectations.10, 11, 12 Faculty that do not match sex-role expectations (stereotypes), such as those in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines are particularly vulnerable.10, 13, 14 Recent research and commentary have successfully focused attention on gender disparities in STEM disciplines.13, 14 Unfortunately, though, gender disparities in the biological sciences, especially in medicine, have not been explored with such rigor. Medicine also presents a more complex environment, considering that postgraduates in medicine are apprentices (trainees), the traditional classroom environment is not the norm, the curriculum is fluid, female representation across various specialties is highly variable and in an academic medical institution, faculty often carry a dual role of physician and physician-scientist simultaneously. Hence, understanding the influence of gender on how trainees view and value female physicians, especially those in male-dominated specialties is crucial, providing a window into perceptions of female physicians as mentors and educators, which in turn directly and indirectly impacts the career path of these physicians. The aim of this study was to report trainee evaluations for male and female physicians and how these may interact with certain gender expectations, with specific attention paid to specialties that have traditionally had low female representation.

Results Table 1 lists the demographic variables for all faculty. Females constituted a greater percentage of faculty at the Clinical Instructor (69%) rank. Furthermore, among the physician-scientists that comprise the professoriate track at SU-SOM, female representation was lower, accounting for only 28% of the total strength. Overall, underrepresented minority faculty, consisting of African Americans, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, made up less Conclusions The results of this study show that, overall, female faculty in academic medicine receive significantly lower evaluation scores from trainees than their male colleagues. Further, there are gender disparities by academic rank and track in our sample, with female faculty making up under a quarter of the Professor rank and less than 30% of the physician-scientist, Professoriate track. Female faculty are also, as would be expected, underrepresented in specialties that are considered to be Acknowledgment The authors wish to thank the Department of Graduate Medical Education and the Office of Academic Affairs at Stanford University School of Medicine for their valuable input.

In an experimental vignette study, 503 undergraduate students from a Canadian university were randomly assigned to read a fictitious online review, similar to those found on RateMyProfessors.com, that varied professor gender, overall quality score and level of caring for students. Students responded to items assessing their likelihood to take a course with the professor, perceived competence and warmth of the professor, and their own gender bias. An analysis of variance revealed an interaction between professor gender, student gender, quality score and caring. When quality score was low, male students indicated a lower likelihood of taking a course with female professors who were not described as caring. Regression analyses showed, however, that students' gender bias was negatively associated with likelihood to take a course with a female professor. These results imply that student gender plays a role in evaluations of female professors who do not display stereotypical warmth but that gender bias, which is typically higher for males at the group-level, may be an underlying factor.

Methods: Between September 2004 and June 2005, third and fourth year students at the 125 allopathic medical schools received an online survey conducted by the American Medical Women's Association (AMWA). Students rated the extent to which 44 topics were included in curricula from 1 to 4 (1 = no coverage, 4 = in-depth coverage) and their preparedness to perform 27 clinical skills (1 = no preparation, 4 = thorough preparation). Results: From 101 of the 125 schools, 1267 students responded (mean number of respondents/school = 13, SD 12). The mean curriculum rating (2.53, SD 0.52) indicated brief to moderate coverage of topics. The mean preparedness rating was higher (3.09, SD 0.44), indicating moderate preparedness. In a regression model, female student sex and site of an AMWA chapter were associated with lower mean combined curriculum and preparedness ratings (female 2.76, male 3.01, p < 0.001; AMWA 2.77, non-AMWA 2.89, p < 0.001), whereas other school characteristics (female dean, federally funded women's health program, and proportion of tenured women faculty) had no association. Conclusions: Although medical students reported that they were moderately prepared to care for women, their low rating of curriculum coverage of women's health and sex/gender-specific topics suggests important gaps in teaching. Lower ratings by female students and by those at AMWA schools may reflect differences in students' knowledge, educational expectations, or perceptions about the importance of topics.
