Strengthening the Teaching Profession Through National Certification JAMES A. KELLY Nationcl Board for Professional Teaching Standards A voluntary national certification system for teachers is being developed by a new organization, the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. The mission of the National Board is to establish high and rigorous standards for what teachers should know and be able to do, to establish a system for Board certification, to develop a state-of-the-art assessment system to ascertain who meets the standards for Board certification, and to encourage adoption of related education reforms intended to improve student learning. Board certification is at the heart of efforts to strengthen the teaching profession. Complementing other education reforms, Board certification can lead to markedly improved student learning. It can also provide both recognition of excellent teachers and there are many and a standard toward which all teachers can aspire. In my comments today, I will review the pressing social need to strengthen the teaching professions, describe the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, suggest standards for good teaching that should characterize the profession, discuss criteria for an effective assessment based on those standards, and offer an early glimpse of the impact Board certification and asses-,ment can be expected to have on the teaching profession in the next few de odes. Why It Is Important to Strengthen the Profession Dismal assessments of the state of Amencan education have been all too common in the past decade. However accurate the findings or inflammatory the rhetoric, they leave us pondering some hard facts about the challenges facing American schools in an increasingly complex global society
No longer can we rest smugly secure in the knowledge 1-at the U.S. economy leads the world. We face instead an econo:ny in transition, an economy challenged on many fronts by international competition. It is said that schools are failing to prepare the next generation of workers for the new competitive environment. The traditional social mission of American schools to build a cohesive society from a plethora of diverse voices has never been more relevant. We are a nation growing more diverse every day. But the traditional structures that help socialize children have also undergone rapid changes. The traditional family may never look quite the same again. In many communities, churches no longer play the strong role they once did. Precious few unifying elements save perhaps pop culture, sports, and the media bind us together. The common school must be the bedrock of a cohesive society. The schools, we are teld, are trying to do too much and succeeding in doing too little, achieving neither excellence nor equity. At a time when we have never demanded so much of citizens, we are told that ou, 17-year-olds du not know enough about civics, literature, math, science, geography, and worse, know even less of history and its lessons. :et we ask even mere of our schools The very individualism that may be our economic lifeblood must be balanced by a sense of civic duty to country and personal responsibility to one another Schools should be nutunng that commitment :-) the public good. More than ever, then, schools need to achieve what Dewey proclaimed as their mission earlier in this century the maximum development of each individual. Functioning ;n a democratic society today, a society framed by a broader global community, students must become competent in the use of technology for learning and communication, understand foreign languages and cultures, and possess far more than basic math and science skills. Students must be able to learn how to think for a living and must possess skills that permit lifelong learning and adaptation to the challenges of the next century Faced with this agenda, the nation has never needed excellent teachers more, but new problems have emerged in the teacher work force. The profession's present salary structure, the teacher's role in the classroom, and the low status associated with teaching do little to attract sufficient numbers of qualify -d new candidates or to encourage the retention of the best and most ab'e practitioners. The problem of teacher supply has also been exacerbated ac new windowc of opportl1 u nity have opened for women and minorities in other fields And the problem of supply is most critical in the case of minority teachers; simply put, we have too few minority teachers in the classroom, and without such role models we are attracting even fewer to the next generation of teachers. Worries about the quality of teachers have also been voiced Though dozens of "accountability measures" have been spawned, many educators, as well as government and business leaders, continue to express doubts concerning the quality of teaching in schools. There are at present no nationally accepted professional teaching standards to which teachers can aspire Indeed, the authority structure of school organizations often places little faith in the wisdom of teaching practice. Status at least in terms of money and power over the decisions affecting classrooms accrues to those who are farthest from the classroom Little distinction is made between the first-year and twentieth-year teacher These factors combine to shape an image of the profession that is often frustrating to those who elect to venture into it. At a time when education is more critical than ever, we mu &t strengthen the profession if we are to meet these challenges to the education system The National Board The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is a nonprofit organization whose main purpose is to establish high and rigorous standards for what teachers should know and be able to do and to certify teachers who meet the standards The Board's goal is a strengthened teaching profession that will raise the quality of education available to children in the United States Profession, such as medicine, architecture, and accounting have national system,: of professu,nal certification, but teachers are subject only to state licensing !,ystems that set minimum standards for beginning teachers. Board certification will go far beyond state licensing Because Board certified teacher,' w",l have met high and rigorous standards, certification will become a r ublic affirmation that a teacher is a true professional who exhibits creativity and imagination in solving complex problems and hat, command of subject matter and how to convey its central tenets in a variety of ways to all students Board certification is intended to be a declaration that a teacher can effectively 3 exercise independent professional judgment on a variety of instructional matters that affect learning In this way, the Board's requirements will be similar in many respects to the standards other professionals must meet. While compulsory licensing standards vary from state to state, the Board expects to adopt a single set of standards and assessment practices to be applied uniformly across the country. Such a practice will facilitate state reciprocity agreements and thereby enhance teacher mobility, a valuable benefit at a time when the demand for teachers from state to state is likely to be highly variable Board certification is being offered as a voluntary vehicle for teachers to help them help themselves in terms of professional advancement and recognition Governors, legislators, and state education officials familiar with the Board understand that Board certification is intended to be voluntary. Each state and locality will have to decide for itself in what manner and to what degree it wishes to recognize Board-certified teachers While it is unlikely that states will choose to adopt the Board's standard as their licensing standard, there is interest in moving to performance-based licensing examinations and in c. eating "Boardcompatible' licensing systems For example, the sate departments of education in Connecticut and California have established the New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium to move in just this direction. The plan of Educational Testing Service to design and develop a new National Teacher Examination is an tinportant and welcome step that will surely improve the assessment of persons seeking state licenses to teach. A 63-person board of directors governs the Board; a majority of the members are actively engaged in teaching elementary- and secondaryschpol children The hoard of directors also includes state and local officials with responsibilities for elementary and secondary education and leaders from the business community and Ingher education Two-thirds of the Board is made up of teaching professionals Eventually, these teaching prc:,ssional members will be elected by Board-certified teachers Until that time, one-third are teacher-union leaders; one-third are teachers who have achieved dr,tii:tion in subject matter or teaching-specialty fields, and one-third are teachers selected solely on the basis of outstanding records of accomplishment in the classroom 4 As a reflection of the many constituencies that are stakeholders in elementary and secondary education, one-third of the Board is made up of public and other educators. This category consists of people whose responsibilities fall in the following fields: governance of education (governors, state legislative leaders, chief state school officers, state and local board of education members); management of education (schcol principals and superintendents); higher education (university administrators and faculty members), and leaders of the minority and business communities. The Board has been endorsed by the National Governors' Association, the National Education Association, and the American Federation of Teacher- by editorials :n the nation's leading newspapers; and by countless leaders from education, business, and public life. It is widely regarded as having the potential to achieve strategic improvement in the quality of education in 'he United States. Standards for Certification The National Board is expected to adopt a formal statement of teaching standards during the spring of 1989. Although the following comments do not reflect formal Board policy, they are consistent with the direction and substance of Board thinking in late :38. Our vision is shaped by an image of teaching that is complex but grounded in knowledge that can be learned and applied by most teachers. We see teachers as informed and principled decision makers, professionals who make thousands of small and large decisions influenced by host of complicating factors. Like the anthropologisk in the field or the scientist in the laboratory, what teachers do is guided by working hypotheses, educated guesses about the nature of what happens. . hese working hypotheses are constantly tested, revised, and revannped in the light of what is known about teaching and by teachers' own knowledge and experience. Take, for example, one teacher, one student, and one lesson objective that is presumably unambiguous: teaching the concept of d( 1- mals At any given moment during the lesson, the teacher weighs and acts on a shifting complex of information. What does that child already know? How must this new knowledge be linked to other concepts? What are the special strengths and weaknesses of the learner in abstract and linguistic reasoning? How well does he or she understand
numbers and operations performed on them? What interests does he or she have that might be used in developing stimulating problems? For example, could enthusiasm for baseball be used to transform the concept into a question of batting averages? How is that one learner situated in the classroom or in the smaller group within that classroom? What material be it a blackboard, an overhead, or some material to manipulate can be used to demonstrate the concept? How will the knowledge be evaluated? What time of day is it? How lorg will the student's attention span last? What does the teacher do if the planned attack or. the concept simply does not work? And of course, each working hypothesis or decision is never mad? for only one learner at a time. The teacher makes decisions for 25 or more children simultaneously, weighing the best answers for the group. Amidst this Babel of competing interests, the teacher is charged with selecting plausible solutions. Such decision-making skills are not the hallmark of every occupation; rather, they are caaracteristics of a profession where practitioners make judgments by drawing on professional skills and knowledge learned from both training and experience. The more one has the chance to hone these decision-making skills, the better they become. Thus professional experience becomes a critical component in developing and evaluating professional competence Let us Aiwa) s remember that there is no single right answer to many of the most important questions in teaching. Accomplished professional teachers are committed to their students and their students' learning. They treat all students equitably and understand the personal and instructional implications of student differences. These teachers are skilled at diagnosing and facilitating learning. Armed with a variety of methods and modes of interaction, they must create, enrich, and on occasion alter the organizational structures in which they work with young people They find ways to capture and sustain the interest of students; moreover, they are adept at pacing and evaluating their students' learning. They make efficient and effective use of time availaole to them In order to make good decisions, teachers must know the subjects they teach, how to teach those subjects to students, and how thei- students learn and develop Teachers oreanize instructional settings that allow students to develop an appreciation for the interconnections that exist between and among disciplines They model the modes of inquiry appropriate to the subject. But they are also schooled in the 6 1t lore of teaching how to manage a classroom, how to discipline effectively, how to use curricular materials, how to plan and execute lessons. Because they are professionals, teachers continually think about and learn from experience. As critical thinkers, teachers are also members of learning communities. They work in collaboration with other teachers in collegial settings to improve school-wide learning. Teachers undersand the environments from which their students come and are mindful of their students' many needs. Professional teaching standards derived from a view of teachers as sophisticated decision makers are most likely to be accepted if they come from an enterprise such as the National Board, which is rooted in the teaching profession itself, yet incorporates the voices of other constituencies and stakeholders in education The Assessment Challenge While the standards I have described represent a sound basis from which to develop an assessment of effective teaching, they also remind us that current tests of teachers are not oriented toward this view Currently, state licensing examinations assess, almost exclusively through paper-and-pencil technology, a limited range of minimal competencies. But no assessment yet exists in teaching that is based on the ways in which teachers make decisions and exercise professional judgment Models for such assessments do exist in other professions, however. When architects or dr tors are certified as professionals, the assessment reflects the fact that certified architects or doctors must be able to make good decisions. In the architect's registrant examination, candidates are given a design problem in which they must use their knowledge to desigri a structure that meets a client's needs In the patientmanagement problems of medical licensing examinations, physicians make judgments when considering a specific history and demonstrate that they know which questions to ask in order to make an appropriate diagnosis. In the board-certification examinations for physicians, patient histories are discussed in great detail, and decisions about treatment are examined in light of diagnoses and known outcomes. In the California bar exam, candidates are given a client problem along 7 L. with the case history, depositions, and relevant raw material, they then prepare an appropriate response, such as a brief, letter, or appeal In each of these cases, certified professional practitioners judge responses on the basis of the context and constraints presented as well as on what is generally conside- -xi to be sound professional practice. No such assessment reflecting knowledge, judgment, and context is in common use in teaching, however. If we are to take these standards seriously, we must realize that we have set before us an assessment task of eilormous proportions, one that will absorb all of us for several years to come. Measuring the kinds of skills and competencies outlined above far outdistances present assessment models in teaching. The technical expertise of the assessment community and the wisdom of practice of teaching professionals must be married in the new assessments. We envision a research and development effort of several years, costing nearly $50 million, to develop such assessments in the diverse fields that charactenze the teaching profession. The Board's research plans will be publicly announced so qualified organizations can submit proposals. Research results and findings will be made public so the entire profession can benefit from what is learned. The National Board is about to begin that research effort. We will be guided, in part, by the standards of the measurement community. Developing assessments that are both valid and reliable is essential At every stage, we must ask ourselves: Do these assessments measure what they purport to measure? Can the results be relied on with confidence? Surely an effective assessment must be consistent and fairly administered. Such a benchmark requires that our certification process follow those precepts of assessment development that require both time and care: careful field-testing, thorough training of jurors, and scrupulous examination of results for accuracy and fairness. But ultimately the validity of this assessment will not be judged in technical terms. The primary crit'rion for validity of certification within the teaching profession is its recognition as credible by excellent teaching professionals, by other educators, by members of governing board-;, and by the public Certification must align itself with the realities and rigors of pr2ctice and represent the best of the profession. The certification developed by the Board w:11 be designed to meet this criterion. Unlike many other teacher tests, this assessment will not be
