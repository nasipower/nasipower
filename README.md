Quantitative evaluation of the requirements for the promotion as associate professor at German Medical Faculties Heiko Sorg*,1 and Karsten Knobloch1 Author information Article notes Copyright and License information PMC Disclaimer Go to: Abstract Background: First quantitative evaluation of the requirements for the promotion as associate professor (AP) at German Medical Faculties Material and methods: Analysis of the AP-regulations of German Medical Faculties according to a validated scoring system, which has been adapted to this study. Results: The overall scoring for the AP-requirements at 35 German Medical Faculties was 13.5±0.6 of 20 possible scoring points (95% confidence interval 12.2-14.7). More than 88% of the AP-regulations demand sufficient performance in teaching and research with adequate scientific publication. Furthermore, 83% of the faculties expect an expert review of the candidate´s performance. Conference presentations required as an assistant professor as well as the reduction of the minimum time as an assistant professor do only play minor roles. Conclusion: The requirements for assistant professors to get nominated as an associate professor at German Medical Faculties are high with an only small range. In detail, however, it can be seen that there still exists large heterogeneity, which hinders equal opportunities and career possibilities. These data might be used for the ongoing objective discussion.
Methods Inquiries of the regulations to become an associate professor (AP) The AP-regulations have been downloaded of the respective internet sites of the different German Medical Faculties or have been ordered and sent via e-mail. In the case that special information could not be gained from the regulations, medical faculties have again been contacted via e-mail or telephone for respective details. Using this technique 35 out of 36 (97%) AP-regulations could be included into this evaluation. In one case, the authors could not obtain the regulation neither electronically nor via telephone as the respective document must be used as an internal university document for assistant professors only. The following seven parameters are preconditions for the appointment of an AP at German Medical Faculties, which have been analyzed, evaluated and described. The regulations have been evaluated with special interest to the quality of the performance of the candidates. The respective criteria have been summarized in groups of similar requirements and have then been assessed with a simple scoring system with increasing precision of the information or requirement description as similarly published recently [3], [4]. Herein, the AP-regulation of the medical faculties could reach scores between 0 and 20 points. The single parameters have been assessed according to the following system: 1. scientific publication 0 points: no detailed information available 1 point: no information of necessary numbers 2 points: information on quality ± published in appropriate scientific journals or listed in current contents 3 points: information on authorship and quality ± preferably as single author or manuscripts with creativity that attest scientific competence 4 points: information on authorship and quality ± sufficient and/or adequate quantity of publications in renowned international scientific journals ± 6-12 original articles in renowned international scientific journals 5 points: detailed information on quantity, quality and authorships ± 10 publications, thereof 6 as first author in peer reviewed journals ± 8-10 high ranked original articles predominantly as first author ± 10 publications as first author, thereof 5 in renowned scientific peer reviewed journals ± 12 original articles, 8 first authorships, impact factor 10 in renowned scientific peer reviewed journals 2. research performance 0 points: no detailed information available 1 point: unclear description of achieved research work 2 points: qualified research work or successful research for several years 3 points: qualified research work with raised third-party funds 4 points: qualified research work with raised third-party funds and presentation of future research projects and possible perspectives at the respective institution in research and teaching 3. teaching activity 0 points: no detailed information available or optional documentation 1 point: documentation without specifications 2 points: with quality requirements (successful in teaching) 3 points: with quantitative requirements such as one semester with documentation of at least 15h lecture activity 4 points: with quantitative requirements such as several semesters with at least 4 semesters required courses or 4 years of active practical activity in teaching 5 points: with quantitative requirements such as several semesters and additional evaluation of the didactic ability by students or faculty members 4. scientific conference presentations /posters 0 points: no detailed information on scientific presentations or posters 1 point: list on scientific presentations or posters 2 points: detailed list on scientific presentations or posters with information on quantity, quality and authorship or specification on the five most important presentations 5. reduction of the minimum time as an assistant professor 0 points: no reduction possible or no description 1 point: the reduction of the minimum time as an assistant professor is possible by being listed on the nomination list to a full university professorship or other excellent or extraordinary achievements 6. recommendation of candidates by faculty members 0 points: recommendation is not necessary; application by candidate itself is possible 1 point: the recommendation of respective candidates by one or more members of the faculty is expected 7. evaluation of the capabilities being an associate professor 0 points: no evaluation necessary or no detailed information available 1 point: evaluation by to internal reviewers of the faculty 2 points: evaluation by several reviewers, thereof one reviewer has to be from another university or medical school (external review) Go to: Results The AP-regulations of all 35 German Medical Faculties in 2010 have been 3.7±0.6 years old; with the oldest one being 15 years old and four faculties presented actual regulations from the year 2010. From the 35 included AP-regulations 7 have been valid for the entire university (20%), while the majority (n=28) has been especially designed for medical faculties (80%). The total score for the requirements to become an associate professor at German Medical Faculties is 13.5±0.6 (95% confidence interval 12.2 – 14.7), while three faculties could reach 19 of 20 possible scoring points. Six faculties have reached only scores of equal or less than 10 points. Associate professorship requirements The 35 included AP-regulations of German Medical Faculties have been analyzed and scored for seven main items as summarized in table 1 (Tab. 1) [5]. In agreement with all analyzed actual regulations, only the criterion of a respective teaching activity has been designated by all medical faculties (100%). In 94% candidates mandatorily need adequate research achievements. 88% of all German Medical Faculties demand respective scientific publications [5]. Furthermore, 29 out of 35 medical faculties claim an evaluation of the candidates and at 24 locations (69%) the candidate may only apply for a nomination with a recommendation of a faculty member. Scientific presentations are mentioned in 46% as an additional requirement for the nomination. Reduction of the minimum time as an assistant professor is possible at 16 medical faculties after second to third place listing on the nomination list in an appointment process for a full university professorship.

In only two AP-regulations the respective publication activity is not mentioned in detail (5,7%). Most of the medical faculties (51%) could reach the highest score value (5 points) in this category, with detailed information on quantity, quality and first or last authorships (see table 2 (Tab. 2)). On average 8±3 publications (95% confidence interval 9 – 8) are requested of the assistant professors for a successful application in the respective minimum time. These publications should include 6±1 first or last authorships.

Three medical faculties (8.6%) do not give any information on the required research work (0 points) and in seven AP-regulations (20%) only imprecise information is given (1 point; 20%). After reaching successful postdoctoral lecture qualification or nomination for an assistant professorship, eight medical faculties (22.9%) claim ongoing scientific work for several years. Detailed information on the respective research performance with successful raise of third-party funds is given in 31.4%. Four medical faculties additionally demand a perspective concept on future research and teaching performance of the candidates at the respective institutions (5 points; see table 2 (Tab. 2)). teaching activity. The actual evaluation of the teaching activity in the included AP-regulations feature detailed information on form, extent and content of the required teaching modalities for becoming an associate professor. While ten years ago only ten medical faculties (28%) have given some information on the minimum teaching qualifications, the actual analysis of the AP-regulations reveals, that specific information is given in more than 80% (n=28) of the regulations, reaching score values of ≥3 (see table 2 (Tab. 2)). At most of the medical faculties the candidates are allowed to perform every kind of teaching (lectures, seminars, practical courses). At six medical faculties, the AP-regulations claim an additional evaluation of the lectures by students or other faculty members (see table 2 (Tab. 2)). The minimum time requirements, however, differ substantially and are markedly increased at some universities since the year 2000 [2], ranging from 1.5 to 4 semester periods per week (SPW). At some medical faculties, candidates, which act predominantly in patient care, are allowed to reduce the minimum SPW by 50%. In addition, one medical school demands the further education in didactics. A further criterion for a successful teaching performance is the mentoring of doctorate or diploma theses. At 21 medical faculties this is a favored or demanded issue, correlating with an increase of 87.5% in comparison to the year 2000 data [2], [5]. scientific conference presentation/posters. An additional criterion for the successful nomination of an associate professor are scientific presentations or posters. 54.3% of medical faculties do not attach importance on the active participation on scientific congresses or meetings (see figure 1 (Fig. 1)). In other respects, at 16 medical faculties a (detailed) listing of all oral or poster presentations is required for the AP-application.

The nomination of an associate professor can be invested from universities to persons, who have shown outstanding performance and qualifications. The nomination requires a successful and independent performance in research and teaching over several years. After the nomination for an assistant professor or reaching postdoctoral lecture qualification, German Medical Faculties expect different minimum times before these candidates may apply for the associate professor nomination, averaging 4.5±0.3 years (95% confidence interval 3.8 – 5.8). This period of time might be reduced for candidates, which have shown extraordinary scientific performance at 54.3% of German Medical Faculties. This is especially the case, if the candidates have been listed on the nomination list in an appointment process for a full university professorship (secundo et tertio loco). Furthermore, it can also be reduced, when an outstanding scientific price could be won in the area of expertise or in medicine in general. This may reduce the time by four years. At one medical school, the AP-regulations point out that the rejection of a first place listing (primo loco) in an appointment process might directly lead to the nomination as an associate professor. recommendation of candidates by faculty members. At 25 medical faculties (28.6%) assistant professors, which have fulfilled the respective requirements, are not allowed to apply for the AP-nomination. The application process may only start by a recommendation of members or representatives of the faculty or full university professors. These persons are requested to write a recommendation letter or favor the candidates with corresponding documents for the AP-nomination. In all other faculties the candidates are allowed to hand in all documents which are required for the nomination process on their own (see figure 1 (Fig. 1)). evaluation of the capabilities being an associate professor. The abilities and performance for assistant professors, which apply for the nomination to become an associate professor, have to be evaluated by reviewers at most medical faculties. An evaluation is not necessary or is not described in the AP-regulations (0 points) at five medical faculties. The evaluation of the candidates by internal reviewers only, is necessary at three faculties (1 point). The majority (n=27), however, requires an evaluation process, which is supported by an external reviewer from a different university. On average 2±1 reviewers have to evaluate the candidates, focusing not only on the required issues, but also on the general ability for a nomination as an associate professor.
study of Uijtdehaage S, O'Neal C. A curious case of the phantom professor: mindless teaching evaluations by medical students. Medical Education. 2015 Sep;49(9):928-32.
CONTEXT Student evaluations of teaching (SETs) inform faculty promotion decisions and course improvement, a process that is predicated on the assumption that students complete the evaluations with diligence. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this may not be so. OBJECTIVES We sought to determine the degree to which medical students complete SETs deliberately in a classroom-style, multiinstructor course. METHODS We inserted one fictitious lecturer into each of two pre-clinical courses. Students were required to submit their anonymous ratings of all lecturers, including the fictitious one, within 2 weeks after the course using a 5-point Likert scale, but could choose not to evaluate a lecturer. The following year, we repeated this but included a portrait of the fictitious lecturer. The number of actual lecturers in each course ranged from 23 to 52. RESULTS Response rates were 99% and 94%, respectively, in the 2 years of the study. Without a portrait, 66% (183 of 277) of students evaluated the fictitious lecturer, but fewer students (49%, 140 of 285) did so with a portrait (chi-squared test, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that many medical students complete SETs mindlessly, even when a photograph is included, without careful consideration of whom they are evaluating and much less of how that faculty member performed. This hampers programme quality improvement and may harm the academic advancement of faculty members. We present a framework that suggests a fundamentally different approach to SET that involves students prospectively and proactively.
METHODS We inserted one fictitious lecturer into the evaluation forms for two 8-week, pre-clinical, classroomstyle courses (for the Year 2 class of 2010 and the Year 1 class of 2011). We gave these ‘lecturers’ gender-ambiguous names (e.g. ‘Pat Turner’, ‘Chris Miller’) that were distinct from existing names, and added generic lecture titles (e.g. ‘Introduction, Lung Disease’) (Table 1). Students were required to submit their anonymous ratings of all lecturers, including the fictitious ones, within 2 weeks after the course using our online evaluation system CoursEval (ConnectEDU, Inc., Boston, MA, USA). Students were asked to use a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not effective, 5 = very effective) to respond to the question: ‘Please rate the effectiveness of this faculty member’s teaching.’ Optionally, students were able to add written comments on a lecturer’s teaching. Students could choose not to evaluate a lecturer by marking the option ‘Not Applicable’. The following year, we repeated this process (in the classes of 2011 and 2012), but also included a small portrait (150 9 150 pixels) of an attractive young model who, perhaps regretfully, did not resemble any of our faculty members. The number of actual lecturers in each course ranged from 23 to 52, most of whom were depicted in portraits of similar dimensions in our evaluation system. Our electronic system reminded students automatically to complete the evaluations (up to seven times, as necessary) as the deadline for evaluations approached without revealing their identity to administrators. Classroom attendance was voluntary and typically around 75%. Lectures (sound and slides) were made available through podcasts. The University of California Los Angeles Office of Human Research Protection Programme deemed this study exempt from requirements for full institutional review board review as the study was designed not to meet the definition of human subject research as per federal regulations. RESULTS Response rates were 99% and 94%, respectively, in the 2 years of the study. Table 1 lists the numberswho were listed with or without a portrait. Using the full range of the Likert scale, 66% (183 of 277 students) evaluated the fictitious lecturer without a portrait; the remaining 34% (94 students) appropriately chose the option ‘N/A’. The following year, when the lecturer’s name was accompanied by a portrait, fewer students (49%, 140 of 285 students) evaluated the instructor’s effectiveness and 51% chose not to. This was a significant drop compared with the previous year (v2 = 16.50, p < 0.0001). We found, however, an interaction between medical school class and portrait condition, suggesting that a cohort effect may, in part, explain this drop. The class of 2011 (which participated in both years of the study) showed no difference between the noportrait and portrait conditions: 88 of 143 students submitted evaluations when no portrait was provided, and 81 of 145 students did so when a portrait was provided. A handful of students even went so far as to provide comments on the performance of the fictitious lecturers. Although three students explicitly stated that they did not recall the lectures but wished they had (‘I don’t think we had this lecture but it would have been useful!’), three other students confabulated: ‘She provided a great context’; ‘Lectures moved too fast for me’, and ‘More time for her lectures’.

Therefore, the present study or the purpose of evaluating the professional ethics of the teaching of professors from the Viewpoint of medical and pharmacy students was conducted in Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. Methods: The present study is descriptive cross-sectional. The study population included all medical and pharmacy professional doctoral students entering the 99-98 Iranian academic year in which 118 people were randomly selected. The data collection tool was the professional ethics questionnaire of Professor prepared by Sobhaninejad et al. That was in the form of 6 components and 48 items.The scoring scale of the items was based on the Likert five-choice scale from one to five. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics (frequency, mean and standard deviation) and analytical statistics (single group t-test and independent t-test) using SPSS21 statistical software. Result: The total score of teachers 'professional ethics from the students' point of view was 3.59±0.63 and there was no significant difference (p = 0.231) between the views of male (3.5±0.65) and female (3.65±0.61) students. The results of comparing the components of teaching between students of the two fields showed that score of components of standard evaluation and learner cognition from views of medical students were higher than pharmacy students. Conclusion: Although the total average score obtained by the professional ethics of teaching professors in the two schools was at an average and relatively desirable level, is still far from the desired and standard situation and needs more planning by educational planners in order to improve the level of professional ethics of teaching.
